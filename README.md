# Filecutter Toolkit

A collection of tools to help the filecutting process for the Skywind project. This repository is a modified version of the python script by Slaynot, adpated for the needs of the mod team of "Fallout Capital Wasteland- The Pit". All credits go to the original authors at the [original Project](https://gitlab.com/Slaynot/filecutter-toolkit).

See the [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/Slaynot/filecutter-toolkit/-/wikis/home) for more information. Simply exchange `Skywind.py` with `Fallout.py` for the installation instructions, the `install.bat` should work already so manual installation should not be neccessary.
